### The percentage of votes won by each candidate
### The winning candidate based on popular vote

## Audit Summary

### Provided the election data is given in the same format, this script's use could be extended to other types of elections with minimal modification. For instance, the script could be adapted for federal elections. Lists, dictionaries and other data objects referring to counties would of course need to be modified for states, and print statements referring to counties would also have to be altered accordingly to refer to states instead.
